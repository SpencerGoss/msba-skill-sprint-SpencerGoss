# Implementation Plan - SQL Data Warehouse Project

## What Does This Repo Do?

This repository demonstrates how to design and create SQL database tables for customer retention data from a case competition. Case competition data and code can be found in other repository. The project includes:

1. Creating four normalized tables (CustomerDemographics, CustomerUsage, CustomerSupport, CustomerChurn)
2. Defining proper data types and primary/foreign key relationships
3. Adding performance indexes on frequently queried columns
4. Including verification queries to confirm table structure

This shows the foundational database design work that companies need before they can store and analyze customer retention data.

## What Would You Need to Change for Real Company Use?

1. Collect real customer infromation and change the sql data base code so that it can update in real time.
2. Implement some type of security base system to only allow those who are verified to have access to customer data.
